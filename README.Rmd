```{r, include=FALSE}
#install.packages('easypackages')
  rm(list = ls()) # clear the workspace
  library(easypackages) # then we can do the rest in one go
  # get a list of useful packages
  list.of.packages <- c("Hmisc","ggplot2","caret","gplots","Rmisc","dplyr",
            "MatchIt","optmatch","data.table","plotrix","ggthemes",

            "RCurl")

  # check if they are already installed and otherwise install them (not that
  # this doesn't work for biocLite tools!)
  new.packages <- list.of.packages[!(list.of.packages %in% installed.packages()[,"Package"])]
  if(length(new.packages)>0) { install.packages(new.packages)}

  # then load them all
  libraries(list.of.packages)
  rm(list.of.packages, new.packages)
